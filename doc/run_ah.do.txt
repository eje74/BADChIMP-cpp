Problems with WSL:
`WARNING: Linux kernel CMA support was requested via the btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism MCA variable, but CMA support is not available due to restrictive ptrace settings.`
solution found "here":"https://groups.io/g/OpenHPC-users/topic/openmpi_and_shared_memory/16489081?p=,,,20,0,0,0::recentpostdate%2Fsticky,,,20,2,0,16489081"

Apparently previously ptrace could snoop on any process, and setting ptrace_scope to 1 (the default) restricts such introspection to child processes only.

`# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope`
