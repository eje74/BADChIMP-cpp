 * We assume the existence of three types of input-files:
 * (Find better file extension)
 *
 *  1) rank.mpi : Geometry with process partitioning and solids
 *                Solids : 0
 *                Processor rank: 1 + rank (so that rank 0 is 1 etc.)
 *
 *  2) labels_global.mpi : Geometry with local node numbers
 *
 *  3) labels_rank#.mpi : Node number for process # including
 *                        ghost node and boundary-node labels
 *
 *
 * ************* INIT MPI RUN ****************************
 *  ---- How to setup the send and recive protocols -----
 *
 *  General: setup a list that links the current mpi-boundaries
 *           node to the node that it represetns in the
 *           neighboring process.
 *
 *  Example. Scalar from rank a to rank b
 *
 *   node position notation : r = [x0, x1, ...]:
 *
 *     1) Go through all nodes in labels_ranka
 *        and check which are connected to rank b
 *        That is:  rank.mpi[r] == b.
 *        Then we have the number of nodes in the mpi-boundary
 *        linked to b.
 *        Send this number to proc b. Now be knows how much data to
 *        receive.
 *
 *      2) List protocols: (Scalars)
 *        'Rank a node-list '[labels_ranka[r], ... ]
 *        'Rank b node-list' [labels_global[r], ... ]
 *         Send 'Rank b node-list' to rank b proc. and this gives
 *         the order for the data communcation.
 *         We know now that the first element in the sendt array
 *         shold now be assign to the node-label given by
 *         the first entry in 'Rank a node-list'
